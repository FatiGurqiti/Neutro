## Documentation

The app uses [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/), in order to be able to do the tasks simply, replace existing _google-services.json_.


### Usage the app

When opening the app, simply create your account or log in if you already have one. Account tasks are the same as [Lay](https://github.com/FatiGurqiti/Lay) for more detail you may check it.

As mentioned in the title, Neutro helps you to keep track of debt. To do that you have to have contacts. Click on _Add Contact_ and enter e-mail adress of a _Neutro_ user. The app will not allow you enter any other e-mail than one that is registered to _Neutro_. 

You may view or delete your contacts on _Profile_ activity, which you can access by clicking _profile_ Image Button on the top right corner of Main Activity.
